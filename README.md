#Automatic Gate opening and parking system
The project is done using Raspberry Pi. In this demo version, a Pi Cam is used to capture the image. The image is processed using open-cv to make it easier to read. Then PyTesserat
OCR is used for text recognition. If the number is present in the database the gate opens (uses a servo motor). Finally, a few IR sensors are used for the parking system.
